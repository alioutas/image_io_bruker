# Read and write .dat files produced by Bruker Vutara352 and VXL microscopes

This code allows to read .dat files from Bruker Super-Resolution microscopes (Vutara352 and VXL), perform custom analysis in python (not part of this repo), and finally transform a pandas dataframe back to a .dat file format that can be read by Bruker SRX.
